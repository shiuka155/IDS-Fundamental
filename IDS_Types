# Types of Instrusion Detection Systems

## Network-based IDS (NIDS):
- Monitors traffic across the network
- Detect suspicious packets or traffic patterns
- Example: Snort

## Host-based IDS (HIDS):
- Installed on individual system
- Monitors file integrity, system logs, and processes

## Hybrid IDS:
- Combines both NIDS and HIDS capabilities
- Provides broader visibility across systems and network
